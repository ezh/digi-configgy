=============

__A library for handling configurations__

This library was created from original works by Robey Pointer and originally posted @ <https://github.com/robey/configgy>.

Original Configgy library was deprecated by [Ostrich](https://github.com/twitter/ostrich). But Ostrich serialization mechanism for saving configuration files is still broken. Also original Configgy contain few bright ideas.

[See Digi-Configgy documentation](http://ezh.github.io/digi-configgy/).
